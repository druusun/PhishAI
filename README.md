**PhishAI** is a lightweight, scam-baiting iMessage bot built for macOS. It detects potential scam messages, keeps track of known scammers, and sends humorous replies to waste their timeâ€”all powered by an LLM via the OpenRouter API.

## Features

- Scam Detection: Uses a language model to detect common scam indicators in incoming iMessages.
- Auto Response: Automatically replies to known scammers with creative, believable baiting messages.
- Message Tracking: Maintains a cache to avoid duplicate responses and remembers known scammers.
- macOS Native: Leverages AppleScript to read and send iMessages via the native Messages app.

## Prerequisites

- macOS (required for iMessage + AppleScript support)
- Python 3.7+
- iMessage enabled and active in the Messages app

## Installation

git clone https://github.com/your-username/PhishAI.git

cd PhishAI

pip install -r requirements.txt

Create .env file

OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-xxxxx... (Need to fill in your own)

python3 main.py

## How It Works
- The bot polls the local iMessage SQLite database every 30 seconds.
- If a new message arrives:
-   It checks if it's already been replied to.
- If the sender is a known scammer, it replies automatically.
- Otherwise, it uses an LLM to detect scam likelihood.
- If a scam is detected, it adds the sender to the cache and responds.
- All data is cached in cache.json.

## Limitations
- macOS only: Due to reliance on AppleScript and the local Messages DB.
- Must remain open: The script must stay running; it won't work if the machine sleeps or is closed.
- LLM limits: Free usage capped (~1000 daily requests) unless using your own OpenRouter key.
